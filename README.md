# high-standard

ESLint configuration generation for JavaScript/TypeScript.

Installing this module through `npm install high-standard` or `yarn add high-standard` command also installs `eslint`, parsers, and its required plugins. Therefore, installing other them manually are redundant.

Running `high-standard` command will generate _.eslintrc.json_ file alongside your _package.json_.

Upgrading this module requires you to re-run `high-standard` command manually to overwrite _.eslintrc.json_.

Please see [_index.js_](index.js) for how ESLint rules are configured.
